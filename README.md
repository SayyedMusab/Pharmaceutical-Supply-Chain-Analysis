## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
This data analysis project addresses a critical business problem in the pharmaceutical supply chain: inefficient inventory management leading to significant financial losses. These losses stem from expired products, high capital tied up in overstock, and potential stockouts of critical medicines.

By analyzing 18 months of transactional data (Jan 2024 â€“ Jul 2025), this project identifies the key drivers of revenue loss, quantifies their impact, and provides data-backed recommendations to optimize inventory, reduce waste, and improve profitability.

Key Finding: Overstock and product expiry together account for nearly 20% of the total turnover, representing a major opportunity for cost savings and operational improvement.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives of the Analysis
-The primary goal was to deconstruct the components of revenue loss and provide actionable insights. The specific objectives were:

-**Quantify Revenue Loss**: To calculate and categorize the total revenue loss into three primary components: Expiry, Overstock, and Stockouts.

-**Identify Primary Loss Drivers**: To determine which factor (Expiry, Overstock, or Stockouts) contributes the most to financial losses.

-**Analyze Inventory Efficiency**: To assess the relationship between overstock levels and product expiry rates.

-**Develop Strategic Recommendations**: To provide data-driven recommendations for optimizing procurement, reducing waste, and minimizing lost sales.
